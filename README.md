## Perceptron Simulator

The **Perceptron Simulator** is an interactive web-based tool designed to visualize and understand the fundamental concepts of a single-layer perceptron. It allows users to manipulate inputs and biases, observing their effects on the output, which is represented by a simulated potentiometer.

### Features

- Interactive 4x4 grid representing the input layer.
- Adjustable bias values for each input cell.
- Visual representation of the perceptron's output using a potentiometer.
- Automated training buttons to adjust biases for positive or negative outputs.
- Clear visual feedback through cell and bias highlighting.

### Core Functionality (Simulated)

The simulator demonstrates the core functionality of a single-layer perceptron:

- **Inputs (Cells):** The grid cells represent binary inputs (1 or 0).
- **Weights (Biases):** Adjustable biases act as weights, determining input influence.
- **Weighted Sum:** The simulator calculates the weighted sum of inputs based on cell states and biases.
- **Activation Function (Simplified):** The potentiometer's needle position acts as a simplified activation function.
- **Output:** The potentiometer displays the perceptron's output.
- **Training:** Training buttons simulate basic weight adjustment.

### Key Concepts

This simulation helps visualize:

- **Linear Separability:** How input combinations affect output.
- **Weight Adjustment:** How biases alter the output.
- **Simplified Model:** Understanding the basics of a perceptron.

### Relation to MNIST Dataset

While this simulator uses a 4x4 grid, datasets like MNIST require much larger input layers (784 inputs). Single-layer perceptrons have limited use cases with complex datasets like MNIST due to their limitation to linearly separable problems.
